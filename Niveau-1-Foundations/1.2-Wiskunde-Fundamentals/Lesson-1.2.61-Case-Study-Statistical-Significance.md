## Quiz & Assessment

### Quick Check (True/False)
1. Statistical significance implies practical impact. (False)
2. CI gives a range of plausible effects. (True)
3. Hypothesis testing requires a null. (True)
4. p-value below alpha rejects null. (True)

### Conceptual Questions
5. Why report effect size?
6. What is a confounder?
7. How do you communicate uncertainty?

### Coding Challenge
8. Outline steps to compute a t-test and CI.

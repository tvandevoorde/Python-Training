# Lesson 1.2.47: Conditional Probability

**Estimated Time**: 8 hours | **Difficulty**: Beginner  
**Prerequisites**: Lesson 1.2.46 | **Topic**: Probability and Statistics

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define conditional probability
- Explain independence
- Compute simple conditional probabilities
- Interpret dependence in data

---

## Core Ideas

- P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)
- Independence means P(A|B) = P(A)

---

- Exercise 1.2.47.3: Explain independence in words.

### Difficulty 2: Intermediate
- Exercise 1.2.47.4: Compute P(A|B) from a table.
- Exercise 1.2.47.5: Identify independence in a dataset.
- Exercise 1.2.47.6: Explain why conditioning changes probabilities.

### Difficulty 3: Advanced
- Exercise 1.2.47.7: Use conditional probability to compute P(A and B).
- Exercise 1.2.47.8: Explain Simpson's paradox in one sentence.

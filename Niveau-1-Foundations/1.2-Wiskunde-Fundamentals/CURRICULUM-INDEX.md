## Assessment Strategy

### Formative Assessment (ongoing)
- Lesson exercises (3 difficulty levels each)
- Mini-projects after key concepts
- Quick checks and coding challenges in each lesson

### Summative Assessment (milestone tests)
- Test after each major topic
- 80+ points = Pass, continue
- <80 points = Review, retake

### Final Assessment (Capstone)
- Complete statistical analysis dashboard
- Demonstrates linear algebra, calculus, and statistics integration
- Code review ready and report-based

---

## Tips for Success

- Practice with small numeric examples before scaling up
- Draw diagrams for vectors, matrices, and transformations
- Validate intuition with Python and NumPy
- Keep a math notebook for formulas and derivations
- Build mini-projects in parallel with lessons

## Learning Time Estimate

- **At 8 hours/week**: ~62-63 weeks (~15 months)
- **At 20 hours/week**: ~25 weeks (~6 months)
- **At 40 hours/week**: ~12-13 weeks (~3 months)

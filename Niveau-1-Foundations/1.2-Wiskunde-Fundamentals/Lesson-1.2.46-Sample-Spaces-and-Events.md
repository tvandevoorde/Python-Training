# Lesson 1.2.46: Sample Spaces and Events

**Estimated Time**: 8 hours | **Difficulty**: Beginner  
**Prerequisites**: Lesson 1.2.45 | **Topic**: Probability and Statistics

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define sample spaces and events
- Use unions, intersections, complements
- Compute simple probabilities
- Represent events with sets

---

## Core Ideas

- Sample space lists all outcomes
- Events are subsets of outcomes

---

## Exercises

### Difficulty 1: Starter
- Exercise 1.2.46.1: Define sample space for a die.
- Exercise 1.2.46.2: Define event of rolling even.
- Exercise 1.2.46.3: Explain complement of an event.

### Difficulty 2: Intermediate
- Exercise 1.2.46.4: Compute probability of A union B.
- Exercise 1.2.46.5: Use Venn diagram to show intersection.
- Exercise 1.2.46.6: Explain mutually exclusive events.

### Difficulty 3: Advanced
- Exercise 1.2.46.7: Define sample space for two coin flips.
- Exercise 1.2.46.8: Compute probability of at least one head.
- Exercise 1.2.46.9: Express events using set notation.

## Quiz & Assessment

### Quick Check (True/False)
1. Events are subsets of sample space. (True)
2. Complement includes outcomes not in event. (True)
3. Union means outcomes in both events only. (False)
4. Sample space can be infinite. (True)

### Conceptual Questions
5. Why use set notation for events?
6. What does intersection represent?
7. How do you model complex events?

### Coding Challenge
8. Simulate two dice and count events.

## Quiz & Assessment

### Quick Check (True/False)
1. Naive Bayes assumes feature independence. (True)
2. Priors reflect class frequency. (True)
3. Laplace smoothing prevents zero probabilities. (True)
4. Naive Bayes cannot be used for text. (False)

### Conceptual Questions
5. Why is naive Bayes fast?
6. What breaks the independence assumption?
7. How do you evaluate a classifier?

### Coding Challenge
8. Compute posterior for a message with two words.

## Quiz & Assessment

### Quick Check (True/False)
1. Normal distribution is symmetric. (True)
2. Z-scores measure standard deviations from mean. (True)
3. Standardization changes data order. (False)
4. Z-score of 0 equals the mean. (True)

### Conceptual Questions
5. Why standardize features?
6. How does sigma affect spread?
7. When is normal approximation useful?

### Coding Challenge
8. Compute z-scores for a list of numbers.

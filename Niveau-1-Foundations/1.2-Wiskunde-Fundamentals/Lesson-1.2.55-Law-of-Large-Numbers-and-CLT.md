**Estimated Time**: 8 hours | **Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Prerequisites**: Lesson 1.2.54 | **Topic**: Probability and Statistics

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Explain the law of large numbers
- Describe the central limit theorem (CLT)
- Interpret sampling distributions
- Apply CLT intuition to data

---

## Core Ideas

- Averages converge with more samples
- Sums of random variables approach normality

---

## Exercises

### Difficulty 1: Starter
- Exercise 1.2.55.1: Define LLN in one sentence.
- Exercise 1.2.55.2: Define CLT in one sentence.
- Exercise 1.2.55.3: Explain why averages stabilize.

### Difficulty 2: Intermediate
- Exercise 1.2.55.4: Simulate sample means for a dice roll.
- Exercise 1.2.55.5: Explain why CLT is useful.
- Exercise 1.2.55.6: Compare small vs large sample behavior.

### Difficulty 3: Advanced
- Exercise 1.2.55.7: Explain CLT conditions.
- Exercise 1.2.55.8: Discuss non-normal underlying distributions.
- Exercise 1.2.55.9: Relate CLT to confidence intervals.

## Quiz & Assessment

### Quick Check (True/False)
1. LLN says averages converge to expected value. (True)
2. CLT requires original data to be normal. (False)
3. Larger samples reduce variance of the mean. (True)
4. CLT is key for inference. (True)

### Conceptual Questions
5. Why does CLT matter for ML?
6. How do sample size and variance relate?
7. What is a sampling distribution?

### Coding Challenge
8. Simulate 1000 sample means and compute their std.

## Key Takeaways

- LLN explains stability of averages
- CLT explains normality of sums
- Sampling distributions power inference
- Larger samples reduce uncertainty

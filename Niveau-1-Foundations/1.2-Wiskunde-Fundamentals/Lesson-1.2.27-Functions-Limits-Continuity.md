## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define functions and inputs/outputs
- Explain limits with intuition
- Describe continuity and discontinuity
- Use limits in derivative concepts

---

## Core Ideas

- Functions map inputs to outputs
- Limits describe behavior near a point
- Continuity means no jumps

## Exercises

### Difficulty 1: Starter
- Exercise 1.2.27.1: Define a function in words.
- Exercise 1.2.27.2: Give an example of a discontinuity.
- Exercise 1.2.27.3: Explain a limit with a picture.

### Difficulty 2: Intermediate
- Exercise 1.2.27.4: Describe left vs right limits.
- Exercise 1.2.27.5: Identify continuous intervals of a function.
- Exercise 1.2.27.6: Explain why limits matter for derivatives.

### Difficulty 3: Advanced
- Exercise 1.2.27.7: Provide a piecewise function with a removable discontinuity.
- Exercise 1.2.27.8: Explain epsilon-delta in words.
- Exercise 1.2.27.9: Discuss limits at infinity.

## Quiz & Assessment

### Quick Check (True/False)
1. A function maps inputs to outputs. (True)
2. Limits describe exact values only at a point. (False)
3. Continuity means no breaks. (True)
4. Discontinuity can be removable. (True)

### Conceptual Questions
5. Why are limits useful?
6. How does continuity affect optimization?
7. What is a piecewise function?

### Coding Challenge
8. Write a function f(x) = 2x + 1 and compute f(4).

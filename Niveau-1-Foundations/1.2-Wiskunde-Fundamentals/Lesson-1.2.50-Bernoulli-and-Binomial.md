## Quiz & Assessment

### Quick Check (True/False)
1. Bernoulli is a single trial. (True)
2. Binomial requires independence. (True)
3. Binomial has parameter lambda. (False)
4. p is success probability. (True)

### Conceptual Questions
5. Why is binomial useful in ML?
6. How do n and p change the distribution?
7. When is normal approximation reasonable?

### Coding Challenge
8. Simulate 1000 Bernoulli trials and compute mean.

# Lesson 1.2.57: Hypothesis Testing Basics

**Estimated Time**: 8 hours | **Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Prerequisites**: Lesson 1.2.56 | **Topic**: Probability and Statistics

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define null and alternative hypotheses
- Explain test statistics
- Interpret p-values
- Identify type I and type II errors

---

## Core Ideas

- Hypothesis tests compare data to a null model
- P-values quantify evidence against the null

---

## Exercises

### Difficulty 1: Starter
- Exercise 1.2.57.1: Define null hypothesis.
- Exercise 1.2.57.2: Define alternative hypothesis.
- Exercise 1.2.57.3: Explain p-value in words.

### Difficulty 2: Intermediate
- Exercise 1.2.57.4: Describe type I and type II errors.
- Exercise 1.2.57.5: Explain significance level.
- Exercise 1.2.57.6: Interpret a p-value of 0.03.

### Difficulty 3: Advanced
- Exercise 1.2.57.7: Explain power of a test.
- Exercise 1.2.57.8: Describe multiple testing issue.
- Exercise 1.2.57.9: Connect hypothesis tests to A/B testing.

## Quiz & Assessment

### Quick Check (True/False)
1. Null hypothesis is the default assumption. (True)
2. Smaller p-values mean less evidence against null. (False)
3. Type I error is false positive. (True)
4. Significance level is alpha. (True)

### Conceptual Questions
5. Why do we need hypothesis tests?
6. What does a p-value represent?
7. How do you choose alpha?

### Coding Challenge
8. Describe how to compute a test statistic for mean difference.

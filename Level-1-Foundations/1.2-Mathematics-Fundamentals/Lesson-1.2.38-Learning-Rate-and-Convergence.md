# Lesson 1.2.38: Learning Rate and Convergence

**Estimated Time**: 8 hours | **Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Prerequisites**: Lesson 1.2.37 | **Topic**: Calculus for ML

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Explain learning rate effects
- Identify divergence vs convergence
- Describe step size schedules
- Choose practical learning rates

---

## Core Ideas

- Too large diverges, too small is slow
- Schedules adjust learning rate over time

---

## Exercises

### Difficulty 1: Starter
- Exercise 1.2.38.1: Define learning rate.
- Exercise 1.2.38.2: Explain what divergence looks like.
- Exercise 1.2.38.3: Describe slow convergence.

### Difficulty 2: Intermediate
- Exercise 1.2.38.4: Try multiple learning rates on f(x)=x^2.
- Exercise 1.2.38.5: Plot loss curves for each rate.
- Exercise 1.2.38.6: Explain learning rate schedules.

### Difficulty 3: Advanced
- Exercise 1.2.38.7: Discuss adaptive methods intuition.
- Exercise 1.2.38.8: Explain why curvature matters.
- Exercise 1.2.38.9: Provide a rule of thumb for tuning.

## Quiz & Assessment

### Quick Check (True/False)
1. Learning rate controls step size. (True)
2. Smaller learning rate always better. (False)
3. Schedules can improve convergence. (True)
4. Divergence means loss increases. (True)

### Conceptual Questions
5. Why do schedules help?
6. How does curvature affect step size?
7. What is a safe tuning strategy?

### Coding Challenge
8. Compare two learning rates for f(x)=x^2.

## Key Takeaways

- Learning rate is critical for stability
- Schedules can improve training
- Divergence signals too large steps
- Tuning is empirical and data-driven

# Lesson 1.2.58: p-values and Confidence Intervals

**Estimated Time**: 8 hours | **Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Prerequisites**: Lesson 1.2.57 | **Topic**: Probability and Statistics

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Interpret p-values correctly
- Define confidence intervals
- Explain confidence level meaning
- Use intervals for uncertainty reporting

---

## Core Ideas

- P-values measure evidence against the null
- Confidence intervals show plausible ranges

---

## Exercises

### Difficulty 1: Starter
- Exercise 1.2.58.1: Explain p-value in one sentence.
- Exercise 1.2.58.2: Define confidence interval.
- Exercise 1.2.58.3: Explain 95% confidence level.

### Difficulty 2: Intermediate
- Exercise 1.2.58.4: Interpret a confidence interval that includes 0.
- Exercise 1.2.58.5: Explain relationship between p-value and CI.
- Exercise 1.2.58.6: Describe common p-value misuse.

### Difficulty 3: Advanced
- Exercise 1.2.58.7: Explain effect of sample size on CI width.
- Exercise 1.2.58.8: Discuss one-sided vs two-sided intervals.
- Exercise 1.2.58.9: Connect CI to practical significance.

## Mini-Project: CI Summary

Write a short summary of a confidence interval for a mean.

## Quiz & Assessment

### Quick Check (True/False)
1. P-value is the probability the null is true. (False)
2. Confidence interval gives a range for parameter. (True)
3. Larger samples yield narrower intervals. (True)
4. CI and p-values are unrelated. (False)

### Conceptual Questions
5. Why do we report confidence intervals?
6. What does it mean if CI includes zero?
7. How should p-values be interpreted?

### Coding Challenge
8. Compute a simple CI for a sample mean (assume known sigma).

## Key Takeaways

- P-values measure evidence, not truth
- Confidence intervals show uncertainty
- Sample size affects interval width
- Correct interpretation prevents misuse

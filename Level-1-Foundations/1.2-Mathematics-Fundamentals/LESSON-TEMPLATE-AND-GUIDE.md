## Key Design Principles for All Lessons

### 1. Progressive Complexity
- Start: Simple, concrete numeric examples
- Middle: Build complexity gradually
- End: Apply to ML or data contexts

### 2. Balance Theory with Practice
- ~40% explanation/theory
- ~60% examples, exercises, projects

### 3. Multiple Difficulty Levels
- Starter: single concept, guided
- Intermediate: combine 2-3 concepts
- Advanced: open-ended problem solving

### 4. Variety in Exercise Types
- Fill in blanks
- Modify existing code
- Build from requirements
- Debugging
- Open-ended analysis

### 5. Assessment at Multiple Levels
- Quick checks (factual)
- Conceptual questions (understanding)
- Coding challenges (application)

### 6. Real-World Connection
- Show where concepts are used in ML
- Mini-projects solve actual problems
- Use data-focused examples

---

## Math-Specific Guidelines

- Start with intuition and visuals before formulas
- Use clear variable naming and units
- Validate formulas with small numeric examples
- Highlight common misconceptions
- Use Python/NumPy to confirm results

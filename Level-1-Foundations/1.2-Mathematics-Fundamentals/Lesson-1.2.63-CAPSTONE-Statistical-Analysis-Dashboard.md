**Estimated Time**: 8 hours | **Difficulty**: Advanced  
**Prerequisites**: Lessons 1.2.1 - 1.2.62 | **Topic**: Capstone Integration

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Analyze a real dataset end-to-end
- Compute descriptive statistics
- Visualize distributions and relationships
- Report hypothesis test results

---

## Capstone Overview

Build a dashboard that loads a dataset, computes stats, visualizes, and reports results.

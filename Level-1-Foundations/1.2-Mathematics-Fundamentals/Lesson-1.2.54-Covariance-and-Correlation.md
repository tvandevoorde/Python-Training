---

## Exercises

### Difficulty 1: Starter
- Exercise 1.2.54.1: Define covariance in words.
- Exercise 1.2.54.2: Define correlation in words.
- Exercise 1.2.54.3: Explain correlation range.

### Difficulty 2: Intermediate
- Exercise 1.2.54.4: Compute covariance for small data.
- Exercise 1.2.54.5: Interpret correlation of -0.8.
- Exercise 1.2.54.6: Explain why correlation is scale-free.

### Difficulty 3: Advanced
- Exercise 1.2.54.7: Discuss correlation vs causation.
- Exercise 1.2.54.8: Explain how covariance relates to PCA.
- Exercise 1.2.54.9: Compute correlation matrix in Python.

## Quiz & Assessment

### Quick Check (True/False)
1. Correlation is between -1 and 1. (True)
2. Zero correlation means no relationship always. (False)
3. Covariance depends on scale. (True)
4. Correlation standardizes covariance. (True)

### Conceptual Questions
5. Why does covariance depend on scale?
6. What does negative correlation mean?
7. Why is correlation useful in ML?

### Coding Challenge
8. Compute correlation between two lists.

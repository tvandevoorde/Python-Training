## Quiz & Assessment

### Quick Check (True/False)
1. Estimators use samples to infer population. (True)
2. Bias means estimator has high variance. (False)
3. Consistent estimators improve with more data. (True)
4. Sampling bias can distort estimates. (True)

### Conceptual Questions
5. Why is bias-variance tradeoff important?
6. What makes a good estimator?
7. How does sampling affect inference?

### Coding Challenge
8. Compute sample mean and variance for a dataset.

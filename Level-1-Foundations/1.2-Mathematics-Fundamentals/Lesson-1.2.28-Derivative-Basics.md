# Lesson 1.2.28: Derivative Basics

**Estimated Time**: 8 hours | **Difficulty**: Beginner  
**Prerequisites**: Lesson 1.2.27 | **Topic**: Calculus for ML

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define derivative as slope
- Interpret tangent lines
- Compute simple derivatives
- Connect derivatives to optimization

---

## Core Ideas

- Derivative is rate of change
- Tangent line touches a curve at a point
- Steeper slopes mean faster change

---

- Exercise 1.2.28.3: Describe tangent line meaning.

### Difficulty 2: Intermediate
- Exercise 1.2.28.4: Explain derivative of a constant.
- Exercise 1.2.28.5: Sketch a function with positive derivative.
- Exercise 1.2.28.6: Explain why derivative is zero at a minimum.

### Difficulty 3: Advanced

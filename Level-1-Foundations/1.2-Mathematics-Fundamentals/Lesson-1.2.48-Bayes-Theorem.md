# Lesson 1.2.48: Bayes' Theorem

**Estimated Time**: 8 hours | **Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Prerequisites**: Lesson 1.2.47 | **Topic**: Probability and Statistics

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- State Bayes' theorem
- Interpret prior, likelihood, and posterior
- Solve basic Bayes problems
- Connect Bayes to classification

---

## Core Ideas

- P(A|B) = P(B|A) P(A) / P(B)
- Update beliefs with evidence

---

## Exercises

### Difficulty 1: Starter
- Exercise 1.2.48.1: State Bayes' theorem in words.
- Exercise 1.2.48.2: Identify prior and likelihood.
- Exercise 1.2.48.3: Explain posterior meaning.

### Difficulty 2: Intermediate
- Exercise 1.2.48.4: Solve a basic medical test problem.
- Exercise 1.2.48.5: Explain base rate fallacy.
- Exercise 1.2.48.6: Use Bayes to update a belief.

### Difficulty 3: Advanced
- Exercise 1.2.48.7: Explain Bayes in naive Bayes classifier.
- Exercise 1.2.48.8: Describe likelihood vs probability.
- Exercise 1.2.48.9: Discuss how priors affect results.

## Quiz & Assessment

### Quick Check (True/False)
1. Bayes updates probabilities with evidence. (True)
2. Prior is the same as posterior. (False)
3. Likelihood is P(B|A). (True)
4. Bayes applies to classification. (True)

### Conceptual Questions
5. Why does base rate matter?
6. How do you interpret posterior?
7. What happens when prior is wrong?

### Coding Challenge
8. Compute posterior for a given prior and likelihood.

## Key Takeaways

- Bayes updates beliefs
- Priors and likelihoods shape posterior
- Base rates are critical
- Naive Bayes uses Bayes rule

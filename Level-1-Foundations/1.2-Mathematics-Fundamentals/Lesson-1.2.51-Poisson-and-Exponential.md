## Quiz & Assessment

### Quick Check (True/False)
1. Poisson models counts. (True)
2. Exponential models waiting times. (True)
3. Exponential distribution is memoryless. (True)
4. Lambda is always less than 1. (False)

### Conceptual Questions
5. When would you use Poisson?
6. What does lambda represent?
7. How do Poisson and exponential relate?

### Coding Challenge
8. Simulate 100 Poisson samples with lambda=3.

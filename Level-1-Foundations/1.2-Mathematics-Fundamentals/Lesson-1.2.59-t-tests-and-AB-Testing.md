# Lesson 1.2.59: t-tests and A/B Testing

**Estimated Time**: 8 hours | **Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Prerequisites**: Lesson 1.2.58 | **Topic**: Probability and Statistics

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Explain t-tests and when to use them
- Set up an A/B test
- Interpret p-values for mean differences
- Discuss practical vs statistical significance

---

## Core Ideas

- t-tests compare group means
- A/B testing uses hypothesis testing

---

## Exercises

### Difficulty 1: Starter
- Exercise 1.2.59.1: Define t-test.
- Exercise 1.2.59.2: Explain A/B testing in one sentence.
- Exercise 1.2.59.3: Describe null hypothesis for A/B tests.

### Difficulty 2: Intermediate
- Exercise 1.2.59.4: Explain when to use paired vs unpaired t-test.
- Exercise 1.2.59.5: Interpret a p-value from a t-test.
- Exercise 1.2.59.6: Explain statistical vs practical significance.

### Difficulty 3: Advanced
- Exercise 1.2.59.7: Describe assumptions of t-tests.
- Exercise 1.2.59.8: Explain multiple testing correction.
- Exercise 1.2.59.9: Outline an A/B test plan.

## Mini-Project: A/B Test Plan

Create a plan for an A/B test including metrics and hypotheses.

## Quiz & Assessment

### Quick Check (True/False)
1. t-tests compare means. (True)
2. A/B tests require random assignment. (True)
3. p-value tells effect size. (False)
4. Paired tests use matched samples. (True)

### Conceptual Questions
5. When is a t-test appropriate?
6. Why distinguish practical significance?
7. What can violate t-test assumptions?

### Coding Challenge
8. Describe steps to compute a t-test from two samples.

## Key Takeaways

- t-tests compare group means
- A/B tests formalize experimentation
- Assumptions matter for validity
- Practical significance guides decisions

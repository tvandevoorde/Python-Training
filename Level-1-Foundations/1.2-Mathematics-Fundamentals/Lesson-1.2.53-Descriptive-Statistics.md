# Lesson 1.2.53: Descriptive Statistics

**Estimated Time**: 8 hours | **Difficulty**: Beginner-Intermediate  
**Prerequisites**: Lesson 1.2.52 | **Topic**: Probability and Statistics

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Compute mean, median, mode
- Compute variance and standard deviation
- Interpret spread and center
- Summarize datasets

---

## Core Ideas

- Central tendency measures typical values
- Dispersion measures spread

---

## Exercises

### Difficulty 1: Starter
- Exercise 1.2.53.1: Compute mean of a list.
- Exercise 1.2.53.2: Compute median of a list.
- Exercise 1.2.53.3: Explain standard deviation.

### Difficulty 2: Intermediate
- Exercise 1.2.53.4: Compare mean vs median for skewed data.
- Exercise 1.2.53.5: Compute variance by hand.
- Exercise 1.2.53.6: Explain when mode is useful.

### Difficulty 3: Advanced
- Exercise 1.2.53.7: Compute statistics for grouped data.
- Exercise 1.2.53.8: Explain impact of outliers.
- Exercise 1.2.53.9: Compare two datasets with summary stats.

## Quiz & Assessment

### Quick Check (True/False)
1. Mean can be affected by outliers. (True)
2. Median is robust to outliers. (True)
3. Variance is the square root of std. (False)
4. Mode is always unique. (False)

### Conceptual Questions
5. When is median preferred over mean?
6. Why use standard deviation?
7. What does variance measure?

### Coding Challenge
8. Compute mean and std for a list of numbers.

## Key Takeaways

- Descriptive stats summarize data
- Mean, median, mode describe center
- Variance and std describe spread
- Outliers affect metrics differently

---

## Section A: True/False (10 points, 1 point each)

**1. A function without an explicit `return` statement returns `None`.**
   - A) True
   - B) False
   
   **Answer**: True

**2. The `global` keyword is required to read a global variable.**

   **Answer**: False (only needed to modify)

**3. Lambda functions can contain multiple statements separated by semicolons.**
   - A) True
   - B) False
   
   **Answer**: False (single expression only)

**4. In Python, `local` scope is searched before `enclosing` scope in the LEGB rule.**
   - A) True
   - B) False
   
   **Answer**: False (Local checked, then Enclosing, then Global, then Built-in)

   **Answer**: True

**6. Pure functions can modify global variables based on the function's input.**

   - B) False
   
   **Answer**: True

**10. List comprehensions are always more efficient than generator expressions.**
   - A) True
   - B) False
   
   **Answer**: False (generators are more memory efficient)

---

## Section B: Short Answer (12 points, 2-3 points each)

**11. Explain the difference between a regular function and a generator function. (2 pts)**

Expected Answer:
- Regular functions return all values at once
- Generator functions yield values one at  a time using lazy evaluation
- Generators are more memory efficient for large datasets

---

**12. What does LEGB stand for and briefly explain each level. (3 pts)**

Expected Answer:
- **L**ocal: Inside current function
- **E**nclosing: Inside outer function (nested)
- **G**lobal: Module level
- **B**uilt-in: Python built-in scope

---

**13. Write a one-line lambda function that returns the square of a number. (2 pts)**

Expected Answer:
```python
square = lambda x: x ** 2
```

---

**14. Explain the difference between `*args` and `**kwargs`. (3 pts)**

Expected Answer:
- `*args`: Variable number of positional arguments as tuple
- `**kwargs`: Variable number of keyword arguments as dictionary
- `*args` comes before `**kwargs` in parameter list

---

**15. What is a closure and provide a one-sentence example. (2 pts)**

Expected Answer:
- A closure is a function that "remembers" variables from its enclosing scope
- Example: function that returns another function capturing outer variables

---

**16. What is the purpose of `@wraps` from functools? (2 pts)**

Expected Answer:
- Preserves original function metadata (`__name__`, `__doc__`)
- Prevents wrapped function from losing its identity

---

## Section C: Code Reading (8 points, 2-4 points each)

**17. What does this function print? Explain why. (2 pts)**

```python
x = 10

def modify_x():
    x = 20

modify_x()
print(x)
```

Expected Answer:
- Prints: `10`
- Reason: Function modifies local `x`, not global `x`

---

**18. What is the output of this code? (2 pts)**

```python
def outer():
    x = 1
    
    def inner():
        nonlocal x
        x = 2
    
    inner()
    return x

print(outer())
```

Expected Answer:
- Output: `2`
- Reason: `nonlocal` allows inner function to modify enclosing scope variable

---

**19. Trace this decoratorand determine output. (4 pts)**

```python
def repeat_twice(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        return result + result
    return wrapper

@repeat_twice
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))
```

Expected Answer:
- Output: `Hello, Alice!Hello, Alice!`
- Reasoning:
  1. `greet("Alice")` returns `"Hello, Alice!"`
  2. `repeat_twice` concatenates result with itself
  3. Final output is double

---

**20. What does this generator yield? (4 pts)**

```python
def countdown(n):
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1

gen = countdown(3)
print(list(gen))
```

Expected Answer:
- Output: `[3, 2, 1]`
- Explanation:
  - Generator yields 3, then 2, then 1
  - `list()` consumes all yields into list

---

## Section D: Code Writing (10 points)

**21. Write a function that processes a list of numbers and returns those divisible by 3 using `filter()` and `lambda`. (2 pts)**

```python
def get_divisible_by_3(numbers):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Test
result = get_divisible_by_3([1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 14])
assert result == [3, 6, 9, 12]
```

Expected Answer:
```python
def get_divisible_by_3(numbers):
    return list(filter(lambda x: x % 3 == 0, numbers))
```

Grading:
- Correct use of filter: 1 pt
- Correct lambda expression: 1 pt

---

**22. Write a decorator that validates all arguments are positive before calling the function. (3 pts)**

```python
def validate_positive(func):
    # Your code here
    pass

@validate_positive
def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

# Test
print(multiply(5, 3))  # 15
try:
    multiply(-5, 3)  # Should raise ValueError
except ValueError:
    print("Error caught!")
```

Expected Answer:
```python
def validate_positive(func):
    from functools import wraps
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        for arg in args:
            if isinstance(arg, (int, float)) and arg < 0:
                raise ValueError(f"Arguments must be positive")
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper
```

Grading:
- Decorator structure: 1 pt
- Validation logic: 1 pt
- Proper error raising: 1 pt

---

**23. Create a function that returns a closure for accumulating values. (3 pts)**

```python
def create_accumulator():
    # Your code here
    pass

acc = create_accumulator()
print(acc(5))   # 5
print(acc(3))   # 8
print(acc(2))   # 10
```

Expected Answer:
```python
def create_accumulator():
    total = 0
    
    def add(value):
        nonlocal total
        total += value
        return total
    
    return add
```

Grading:
- Closure structure: 1 pt
- Use of nonlocal: 1 pt
- Correct accumulation logic: 1 pt

---

**24. Write a simple recursive function to calculate factorial. (2 pts)**

```python
def factorial(n):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Test
assert factorial(0) == 1
assert factorial(5) == 120
```

Expected Answer:
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

Grading:
- Correct base case: 1 pt
- Correct recursive logic: 1 pt
